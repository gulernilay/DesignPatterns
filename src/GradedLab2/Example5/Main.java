You are tasked with developing a multimedia application in Java that supports playing various types of media files such as audio and video. Additionally, the application should provide a feature to apply filters and effects to the media files.

Adapter Pattern:
Implement an adapter to allow the multimedia application to play video files using the existing audio player implementation. The adapter should adapt the video playback functionality to the standard interface used by the multimedia application.
Singleton Pattern:
Ensure that the multimedia application follows the Singleton pattern to guarantee that there is only one instance of the application available throughout its lifecycle.
Facade Pattern:
Design a facade to simplify the process of interacting with the multimedia application. The facade should provide methods for playing media files, applying filters/effects, and controlling playback.
Abstract Factory Pattern:
Implement an abstract factory to create different types of media players (e.g., AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer) and filter/effect processors. Each factory should be capable of creating components that support specific media types and processing functionalities.
Your implementation should demonstrate the usage of these design patterns to create a versatile and user-friendly multimedia application that can handle various media types and processing tasks efficiently.

Provide the Java code for your implementation along with explanations of how each design pattern is applied in the context of the multimedia application.
